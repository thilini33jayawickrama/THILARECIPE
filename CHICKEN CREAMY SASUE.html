      <p>This is one of those recipes that will save you on those nights you’re staring at chicken breast or 
        thighs and wondering, “What the heck am I going to make for dinner, fast?”<br><br>

        Here, chicken is seared until golden and served with a creamy mustard sauce that takes barely a
         minute to come together. The trick to making such a simple cream sauce delectable is to mix the 
         cream with 2 types of mustard. Dijon is there for its smooth and mild mustard flavour as well 
         thickening power, while wholegrain mustard adds visual interest and lovely pops of mustard seeds.</p>

      <p>Here’s all you need to make this simple-yet-fabulous chicken dinner:</p>
    <br><b>

      <ul type="square">
        <div class="GP">
        <li>Chicken</li>
        </div>
      
        <p> While I prefer to make this with thighs because they’re juicier and require no prep, 
          it will work just as well with chicken breast. </p>

        <br>

        <div class="GP">
          <li>Cream</li>
          </div>
        
          <p>The creamy base for the sauce. It’s best to use thickened / heavy cream as you get a head start on 
            thickening the sauce. However, it will also work with ordinary pouring cream. </p>
  
          <br>

          <div class="GP">
            <li>Dijon mustard</li>
            </div>
          
            <p> This plus the cream are the two key ingredients for the sauce. Dijon is a smooth, 
              mildly-flavoured mustard that adds flavour as well as thickening the sauce. While not all Dijon 
              mustards are created equal, there’s no need to use a pricey gourmet Dijon here. Just your everyday
               brands are fine. </p>
    
            <br>

            <div class="GP">
              <li>Wholegrain mustard</li>
              </div>
            
              <p> The mustard seeds add visual interest as well as little pops of faint pungency in this sauce. 
                Because this sauce is so simple as it is, I really urge you to use this mustard, but it’s handy 
                to know that it’s not the end of the world if you don’t have it either. Just dial up the Dijon
                 by an extra teaspoon or so to compensate
                 </p>
      
              <br>
              <div class="GP">
                <li>Tarragon</li>
                </div>
              
                <p>  This herb has a mild aniseed flavour with subtle vanilla undertones. It’s commonly paired
                   with both chicken and cream in French cuisine, which means I automatically think it gives 
                   this sauce a “fine dining” pedigree of sorts</p>
                <br>

                <div class="GP">
                  <li>Fresh parsley</li>
                  </div>
                
                  <p>  For a hint of freshness but more for colour than flavour. </p>

  <center><h3><b>How to make Chicken with Creamy Mustard Sauce</b></h3></center>
</div>
<br>
<p>If you’re using boneless chicken thighs as I’ve done, there’s no prep required. However, if you’re using
   chicken breast, you’ll need to split each breast in half to form 2 thin steaks. For the best results, I’d
    also recommend pounding them to an even thickness to both tenderise and cook through evenly.</p>
<br><br>

</div>
<ol>
  <div class="GP">
  <li>Season</li>
  </div>

  <p>both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper. (Note: If using breast, cut in half to form 2 thin steaks, 
    and pound into 1 cm / 1/3-inch even thickness).</p>
    
  <br>

</div>
  <div class="GP">
  <li>Cook chicken</li>
  </div>

  <p>Sear the chicken until golden and cooked through.

    Thighs: Use medium-high heat; 4 minutes on the first side and 3 to 4 minutes on the second side.
    Breast: It will only take around 2 minutes on each side over high heat.</p>
    
  <br>

</div>

  <div class="GP">
  <li>Remove chicken to a plate.</li>
  </div>

  <p>The chicken will rest while we make the sauce. Resting meat is a key step with any cooked protein.
     Resting time allows the juices to re-settle within the meat so when you cut into the chicken to eat it, 
     the juices stay in the meat instead of bleeding on to the plate. Wasted meat juices are the tears of weeping 
     food angels.</p>
    
  <br>

</div>

  <div class="GP">
  <li>Scrape out</li>
  </div>

  <p>and discard any loose burnt bits so you don’t end up with black bits littered in your sauce.</p>
    
  <br>

</div>
  <div class="GP">
  <li>Sauce</li>
  </div>

  <p>To make the sauce, simply put the cream and both mustards into the pan and stir until the mustard has dissolved.
     Scrape the bottom of the pan as you stir if you can feel the fond still stuck, to get all that good stuff into 
     the sauce. Keep heating the sauce until it’s hot and that’s all you need to do. You don’t even need to bring 
     it to a simmer, nor do you need to reduce to thicken the sauce as the dijon mustard thickens it for us.</p>
    
  <br>


</div>

  <div class="GP">
  <li>Serve</li>
  </div>

  <p>To serve, simply place a piece of chicken on the plate and spoon over the sauce. The recipe makes
     about 2/3 cups of sauce which is plenty for the chicken with some leftover to also sauce up your mash or
      vegetable sides!</p>
