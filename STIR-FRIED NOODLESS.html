        <p>Pad See Ew, which means “stir fried soy sauce noodles”, is an extremely popular Thai street 
            food meal and one of the most popular noodles dishes at Thai restaurants here in Australia.<br><br>
            Making a great Pad See Ew at home simply comes down to two things:
        </p>
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <ol>
        <div class="GP1">
        <li>The right sauce</li>
        </div>
        <p>Basic recipes online will instruct you to use little more than just soy sauce and sugar. 
            It takes a little more than that!.</p>

    <br>
    <div class="GP1">
        <li>Caramelising the noodles </li>
        </div>
        <p>Getting a little caramelisation on the noodles makes all the difference between an
            “ok” and “wow, it’s Just like you get at restaurants!”<br><br>
            The trick? Remove the stir fry ingredients. Cook the noodles with sauce separately. 
            Less stuff in the wok (or skillet) to caramelise the noodles. At least, at home. 
            If you’ve got a giant restaurant wok burner, you don’t need to do the noodles separately!

      </div>

      <br><br><br>
<p>I can’t remember where I originally got the recipe from. Probably from David Thompson, the famous
     Australian chef who has dedicated his life to mastering the art of Thai cooking. 
     I’ve made it so many times over the years, I can almost make it with my eyes closed. 
     (Not really….but you know what I mean!)So I had to actually measure the ingredients properly to share the recipe!</p>

    <div class="GP">
    <li>Dark soy sauce </li>
    </div>

<br>

<div class="GP">
    <li>Ordinary or light soy sauce </li>
    </div>
  
    <p> For seasoning (salt) and a bit of flavour. Most of the flavour comes from the oyster sauce and dark soy sauce.

  <center><h3><b>PAD SEE EW INGREDIENTS</b></h3></center>
</div>

<br>
<p>And here are the other ingredients for Pad See Ew:</p>
<br><b>

  <ul type="square">
    <div class="GP1">
    <li>Noodles</li>
    </div>
  
    <p>Pad See Ew is traditionally made with Sen Yai, which are wide, thin fresh rice noodles
       that are not easily accessible. Even most Asian stores in Sydney do not sell them – you usually 
       need to go to a Thai grocery store.<br><br>

      So it is perfectly acceptable, and just as delicious, to make them with any wide flat rice noodles. 
      I use dried rice noodles labelled as “Pad Thai” Rice Noodles (pictured below) because they are the
       widest available at the supermarket. Once rehydrated, they’re essentially Sen Yai Noodles 
       just not quite as wide.</p>
    <br>

    <div class="GP1">
      <li>Chinese Broccoli / Gai Lan</li>
      </div>
    
      <p> This is a key authentic ingredient in Pad See Ew. Otherwise known as Gai Lan or Kai lan, 
        it’s leafy and looks quite different to broccoli, but you’ll notice a similarity in the
         texture of the stems (hence the name).

        If you can’t find it, just sub with other Asian greens, or a combination of
         broccoli or broccolini + spinach.</p>
  
      <br>

      <div class="GP1">
        <li>Chicken and egg</li>
        </div>
      
        <p>Feel free to use other proteins if you wish. But chicken is by far the most popular.</p>
        <br>
  </ul>
  <div class="h222"> 
    <center><h3><b>How to make Thai Stir Fried Noodles</b></h3></center>
  </div>
<br><br>
<ol>
  <div class="GP1">
  <li>Garlic, chicken and Chinese broccoli STEMS first </li>
  </div>

  <p>Using either a wok or large skillet set over high heat, heat the oil then sauté the garlic until
     it goes light golden. Add the chicken then once it mostly changes from pink to white, add the
      Chinese broccoli stems which take longer to cook than the leafy part.

    Once the chicken is cooked (it should only take 2 to 3 minutes), toss the Chinese broccoli
     leaves in and cook for 30 seconds or so just until wilted.</p>
  <br>

  <div class="GP1">
    <li>Push everything to the side</li>
    </div>
  
    <p>to make room to scramble the eggs on the side. This is the traditional Thai way of
       scrambling eggs in Pad See Ew! </p>

    <br>

    <div class="GP1">
      <li>Crack egg</li>
      </div>
    
      <p> straight into the wok. </p>
  
      <br>

      <div class="GP1">
        <li>Scramble egg</li>
        </div>
      
        <p> Then mix to scramble it. Speed is of the essence here – we want scrambled egg not a sunny side up egg! </p>
    
        <br>

        <div class="GP1">
          <li>Add chicken and veg back in</li>
          </div>
        
          <p> Once the noodles are caramelised, add the chicken and vegetables back in. Give it a quick toss 
            just to disperse, then serve!</p>
