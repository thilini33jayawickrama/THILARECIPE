<h3>This is a salad that’s about as far as you can get from Western salads. No mayo! No oil in the dressing!</h3>
    </div>
    
<div class="para1">
    <p>It’s a zingy and spicy cold salad made with green papaya, a fruit which might be unfamiliar to most
         Westerners. Green papaya is simply unripened papaya, and has a juicy and slightly crunchy texture with 
         a neutral taste. More on green papaya below, including a surprise substitution option!<br>

When shredded, flavour clings to the green papaya. The tangle of threads becomes the perfect vehicle 
for carrying the kaleidoscope of tastes in the dressing: sweetness from palm sugar, salty savouriness 
from the fish sauce and dried shrimp, fresh tang from lime, and fiery pungency from a generous one-two
 punch of garlic and chilli.</p>

    <center><h3><b>What goes in Green Papaya Salad</b></h3></center>
  </div>
    <br>
    <p>Here’s what goes into the salad. The dressing ingredients are shown separately below.</p>
    <br><b>

      <ul type="square">
        <div class="GP">
        <li>Green Papaya</li>
        </div>
      
        <p>This is literally unripened papaya fruit that is the shape and size of a melon. The texture
           of the inside is like potato. It’s firm but moist (though not starchy like potato), and ideal for 
           shredding like we do for Green Papaya Salad.The taste is faintly astringent but overall fairly bland.
            You wouldn’t eat it plain like other fruit because it doesn’t have enough flavour.
          Even though it’s considered a fruit, it’s not sweet at all in its unripened state.</p>

        <br>
        <div class="GP">
          <li> Snake Bean</li>
        </div>
      
        <p>Named as such for its length, these are like very long green beans only a bit firmer and
           a bit more scraggly looking. Snake beans have the same texture and a similar flavour to ordinary 
           green beans, which can be prepared in the same way.For this particular recipe, the snake beans 
           are used raw. They are cut into bite size lengths then pounded to soften and absorb the flavour 
           of the dressing.</p><br>

           <div class="GP">
            <li>Cherry Tomatto</li>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>Just every day cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes! Ordinary large tomatoes sliced up will work ok 
            from a flavour perspective, but I’ve never seen them used in this salad.</p>
  <br>
  
  <div class="GP">
    <li>Thai Basil</li>
  </div>
  
  <p>Thai Basil tastes like normal basil with a stronger aniseed and slightly minty flavour. 
    Nowadays it’s fairly widely available in Australia in large grocery stores and green grocers
     (Coles, Woolies, Harris Farms).Best substitute for this recipe is coriander/cilantro.
      It brings a different flavour to this dish, but it’s not unheard of and the best alternative, in my opinion. 
      The next best substitute is ordinary Italian basil.</p></ul>

  <center><h3><b>What goes in Green Papaya Salad Dressing</b></h3></center>
</div>
  <ul tppe="square">
    <div class="GP1">
    <li>Dried shrimp</li>
    </div>
  
    <p>Found at Asian grocery stores, these are dried little shrimp. They are a key ingredient that are pounded
       and add a salty, shellfish umami to the Green Papaya Salad.</p>

    <br>

    <div class="GP1">
      <li>Fish sauce</li>
      </div>
    
      <p>The other ingredient that adds depth and complexity to the dressing. Yes, it’s pungent 
        straight out of the bottle, but it’s considerably diluted once mixed with everything else. 
        If you substitute with soy sauce, you’ll find the dressing a bit lacklustre (in my opinion) so I
         really do urge you not to skip it. (If you’re really worried about it being strong, switch part 
         of it with soy sauce).</p>
         <br>
         <div class="GP1">
          <li>Palm Sugar</li>
          </div>
          
          <p>A sugar derived from palm trees, it’s a sweetener used widely in South-East Asian cooking
             that has a wonderful caramel flavour. Substitute with brown sugar.Palm sugar comes in discs
              or in blocks, such as the cylindrical one pictured above. To ensure it dissolves easily 
              into the dressing, it needs to be grated. I just use a standard box grater.
            
            </p>
      </ul>
      
          <br><r></r>

          <ul type="square">

          <div class="GP1">
            <li>Limes</li>
            </div>
          
            <p>Fresh is the only way! If you don’t have fresh limes, I’d give this recipe a miss.</p>
        
            <br>
            <div class="GP1">
              <li>Garlic</li>
              </div>
              
              <p>Essential, for flavour!.</p>
          
              <br>
  
              <div class="GP1">
                <li>Birds eye chilli Birds eye chilli </li>
                </div>
              
                <p>If you want the real deal, you can’t be shy with the chilli. The fact is,
                   Green Papaya Salad IS spicy! Some are so screamingly spicy you’ll be banging your head 
                   against the table in agony. This one is not quite so brutal, but is still pretty high
                    up on the spice-o-meter.If you’re really concerned, feel free to dial it back to
                     1 chilli. If you skip it, you’ll have yourself a fine salad, but it’s not a
                      Thai Green Papaya Salad!!.</p>

                  <li>Peanuts </li>
                  </div>
                
                  <p>  A good handful of peanuts is an essential part of the Green Papaya Salad experience.
                     They’re mostly tossed through the salad as part of the dressing, some reserved for sprinkling.</p>
