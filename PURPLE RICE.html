    <p>You know those nights when you feel all smug because you got ahead on the weekend and marinated some
       chicken so you could whip up a “quick dinner” during the week, only to realise you didn’t plan for sides 
       to fill out the meal?
Well, today’s recipe is just the sort of thing that will save you. It’s one of those side dishes I 
call a two-in-one because it includes plenty of vegetables as well as a starch to fill out the meal. As opposed to
 making two sides, like mashed potato plus a garden salad..</p>

    <p>Here’s what you need to make this colourful, veg loaded rice!</p>

        <div class="GP">
        <li>Jasmine Rice</li>
        </div>
        <p>I like using jasmine rice in this dish because you get that lovely subtle fragrance. </p>

        <br>
        <div class="GP">
          <li>Red Cabbage</li>
        </div>
      
        <p>Also called purple cabbage, this is what gives the rice the vibrant purple hue! You can use
           plain ole’ green cabbage if you want, but where’s the fun in that.</p>
<br>


<div class="GP">
  <li>Garlic and Onion</li>
</div>
<p>Flavour base aromatics. You will adore the butter garlic flavour in this rice</p>
<br>


<div class="GP">
  <li>Butter</li>
</div>

<p>As above, for promised buttery flavour! You’ll be surprised how buttery it tastes even though we’re only
   using 30 grams / 2 tablespoons of butter.</p>
<br>


<div class="GP">
  <li>Vegetable Stock </li>
</div>

<p>The rice cooking liquid, tastier than water! Use low sodium stock. If yours is full salt, skip the salt in the recipe.
</p>
<br>

<div class="GP">
  <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
</div>
<p>Seasoning for the rice.</p>
<br>

<div class="GP">
  <li>Green Onion</li>
</div>
<p>For fresh garnish at the end, though I wouldn’t say it’s critical.</p>

  <center><h3><b>How to make purple rice</b></h3></center>
</div>

<br><br><br>
<p>One big, fat rice-making rule that applies to ANY rice you cook: DO NOT STIR, DO NOT PEEK once your put
   the lid on the pot! Unless, of course, you like your rice unevenly cooked, gluey and mushy</p>
<br>

<ol>
  <div class="GP1">
  <li>Use a large saucepan</li>
  </div>

  <p>Found at Asian grocery stores, these are dried little shrimp. They are a key ingredient that are pounded
     and add a salty, shellfish umami to the Green Papaya Salad.
     <br><br>Sauté the garlic and onion in the butter until it smells amazing / onion is translucent. Then cook 
     the cabbage for a few minutes until it starts to soften (rather than being stiff and pokey). 
     Don’t let it get completely wilted and soft because it will cook more with the rice.</p>

  <br>
  <div class="GP1">
    <li>Add rice</li>
 </div>
    
    <p>and stir to coat in the garlic butter..</p>

    <br>

    <div class="GP1">
      <li>Add stock</li>
      </div>
      
      <p>then scrape down the sides and push the cabbage-rice under the surface of the liquid, as best you can. 
        The main thing is that you want all the rice under the liquid. A few grains poking above the surface will
         be fine, they will steam-cook.</p>
  
      <br>

      <div class="GP1">
        <li>Cook 12 minutes</li>
        </div>
        
        <p>Bring the liquid to a simmer, then put the lid on and lower the heat to medium low, or low if your burner
           is very strong. Leave to cook undisturbed for 12 minutes. Do not lift the lid to peek and most definitely
            do not stir! That will disrupt the rice cooking and you’ll end up with unevenly cooked rice that’s
            mushy and gluey.<br><br>
            
            Check At the 12 minute mark, working quickly, remove the lid and tilt the saucepan to
             ensure all the liquid has been absorbed. If it has not, leave it on the stove for another minute or two.</p>
    
        <br>

        <div class="GP1">
          <li>Rest 10 minutes</li>
          </div>
          
          <p>Remove the saucepan from the stove with the lid still on and rest for 10 minutes. Never skip 
            the rice resting step! The rice will finish cooking and the liquid on the surface of each rice
             grain gets absorbed = fluffy rice.</p>
      
          <br>

          <div class="GP1">
            <li>Fluff</li>
            </div>
            
            <p>then serve, garnished with a sprinkle of green onion!</p>

            <p>This cabbage rice is fairly neutral flavoured, with a lovely buttery, garlic flavour. Which means 
              it will go with pretty much any dish, and any cuisine, both Western and Asian.
              <br>
              While the possibilities are endless, here’s a starting point for you – some quick mains that 
              I’d serve alongside purple rice:
